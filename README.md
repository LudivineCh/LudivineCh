- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @LudivineCh
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in teaching, coding (Python, SQL, HTML/CSS, JS), science and freediving.
     I got good analytical skills such as critical thinking, data analysis and research.
     I actually graduated a PhD in Science (2016).
     I am a teacher (Math, Science, Coding and English) in a private school. 
     I take the time to work on coding projects during my free time.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning Javascript.
