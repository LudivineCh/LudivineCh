- 👋 Hi, I’m @LudivineCh
- 👀 I’m interested in teaching, coding (Python, SQL, HTML/CSS, JS), science and freediving.
-     I actually graduated a PhD in Science (2016) so I got good analytical skills such as critical thinking, data analysis and research. 
-     I am a teacher (Math, Science, Coding and English) in a private school so I got time to work on coding projects.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Javascript.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on Wed development project.
- 📫 How to reach me : ludivine.chabaud.fr@gmail.com
